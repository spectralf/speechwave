# SpeechWave Development Tasklist

## Phase 1: Project Setup and Core Infrastructure

- [x] Create project repository and directory structure
- [x] Set up virtual environment
- [x] Create requirements.txt with initial dependencies
- [x] Initialize Git repository
- [x] Set up basic logger configuration
- [x] Create main application entry point
- [x] Test environment to ensure all dependencies can be installed

## Phase 2: Hotkey and Audio Handling

- [x] Research and implement global hotkey detection using keyboard/pynput (Refactored to keyboard.hook)
- [x] Create HotkeyManager class for registering and handling global hotkeys
- [x] Implement press and hold detection with callback functionality
- [x] Create AudioRecorder class for microphone access and recording
- [x] Implement audio recording start/stop functionality
- [x] Add audio format settings (sample rate, channels, etc.)
- [x] Create error handling for missing/unavailable microphones
- [x] Test hotkey and audio recording integration

## Phase 3: Whisper Integration

- [x] Research and select optimal Whisper model implementation (Selected faster-whisper)
- [x] Implement WhisperTranscriber class for speech recognition
- [x] Integrate Whisper small model for transcription (Reverted to small from medium)
- [x] Optimize model loading and memory usage (Deferred loading implemented)
- [x] Add caching mechanism for model to avoid repeated loading (faster-whisper handles file caching)
- [x] Implement threading to prevent UI freezing during transcription
- [x] Create fallback mechanisms for transcription errors (Enhanced logging, callback indicates errors)
- [x] Test transcription with various audio inputs (Enabled by Phase 6 integration)

## Phase 4: Text Insertion Mechanism

- [x] Research methods for simulating keyboard input
- [x] Create TextInserter class to handle typing at cursor position
- [x] Implement text insertion via simulated keyboard input (Includes trailing space)
- [x] Add delay configuration to handle application-specific timing needs
- [x] Implement special character handling (Basic handling via PyAutoGUI)
- [ ] Create fallback mechanism for insertion failures
- [x] Test text insertion across multiple applications

## Phase 5: System Tray Integration and Settings

- [x] Design system tray icon with dark mode aesthetics
- [x] Implement SystemTrayManager class using PyQt6
- [x] Create Settings class for managing user preferences
- [x] Implement settings persistence using JSON/YAML
- [x] Create settings UI dialog with PyQt6
- [x] Add hotkey configuration options
- [x] Add application autostart configuration
- [x] Test settings persistence and loading

## Phase 6: Application Integration and User Flow

- [x] Integrate all components (hotkey, recording, transcription, insertion) (Core workflow implemented)
- [x] Implement proper application lifecycle management
- [x] Create startup and shutdown procedures
- [x] Implement error handling and recovery mechanisms
- [x] Add logging for troubleshooting (non-content related)
- [x] Test complete workflow from hotkey press to text insertion

## Phase 7: Performance Optimization and Testing

- [x] Profile application for CPU and memory usage
- [x] Optimize Whisper model loading and inference
- [x] Reduce latency between hotkey release and text insertion (Basic logging added)
- [x] Implement memory management for long-running sessions (Explicit model unload)
- [x] Create automated tests for core functionality (Framework setup)
- [x] Perform manual testing across various applications (Text insertion tested)
- [x] Fix identified bugs and issues

## Phase 8: Packaging and Distribution

- [ ] Research packaging options for Python applications
- [ ] Set up PyInstaller/cx_Freeze for creating standalone executable
- [ ] Create installer using NSIS/Inno Setup
- [ ] Design application icon and branding assets
- [ ] Add version information and metadata
- [ ] Create user documentation
- [ ] Package application for distribution
- [ ] Test installation process on clean systems

## Phase 9: Final Testing and Launch

- [ ] Conduct final end-to-end testing
- [ ] Verify application behavior on different Windows versions
- [ ] Test with various microphone setups
- [ ] Validate system tray behavior
- [ ] Check memory usage during extended sessions
- [ ] Finalize documentation
- [ ] Prepare release notes
- [ ] Create project README with installation and usage instructions
